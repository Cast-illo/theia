				Theia was a Titan goddess, more <br>
				commonly referred to as the <br>
				goddess of shining elements. <br>
				She was associated with <br>
				shining metals, shining <br>
				jewels or shining light. <br>
				She was also known as the <br>
				goddess of sight and the <br>
				Greeks believed her eyes <br>
				were beams of light, helping <br>
				them see with their own mortal <br>
				eyes. She was one of the <br>
				twelve Titans and like her <br>
				famous sisters Phoebe and <br>
				Themis, she was also associated <br>
				with the gift of prophecy <br>
				and had a shrine in Thessaly.
